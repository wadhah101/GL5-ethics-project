## Introduc    tion

Before diving into the rise of artificial intelligence in china we need to explore the exisiting policies and political climate in china but even before that I like to mention a novel called 1984 and leave you to draw the parallels 



## Nineteen Eighty-Four

**Big brother is watching background**

Nineteen Eighty-Four is a novel written by X. It revolves around a world living a dystopian future where utalitirism rained, indivudualism is dead,reality and history are just a matter of opinion.

Constant surveillance of everey citizen is the norm

control of information to such extent that fact are not reality and reality can be changed on the whim of big brother and "the party"

The party have a monopoly on facts and political discourbe ( debates )

society is divided into 3 

- Inner party 2%

- outer party 13% ( bureaucrats )

- the proles, easy to manipulate : creating a fake crisis, nationalistic pandering, common enemy

what this has to do with china ? everything 

## Internet control and the great firewall

**tankman background**

What happened in june 1989 at Tiananmen Square ?

**Absolutely nothing**

As we all know China blocks facebook, twitter, google, wikipedia ... but that can be easily evaded by paying few dollars a month for a VPN. so does china really control the internet ?

How can it control the internet without giving the impression to the average citizen you are doing so ?

The golden shield project or what's know today as the great firewall

- site blocking 

- topic filtering

- search result rearrangement

- mass surveillance

Each company in china is required to hire "content moderators" or whats better known as "sensors". The official number of those workers are **2 million**

Here's the thing, complaning about the goverment is allowed and mostly a blind eye is turned on it but **mobilising people through a rally** is **strictly** censored 

China is about finding a middle ground to maintain control to voice opinions but not let them act based on them.

by law the browsing activity of eveyone is collected by internet provider and passed to the goverment. With the rising of big data and data analysis we can all see what's wrong and the goverment actually uses this data to make political decisions.



In the book "censored distraction and diversion inside china's great firewall" 3 methods are described on how the goverment controls the internet : 

- Fear & threats
  
  - Effective immediatly but there's a reaction of people  trying to seek out infromation if they feel the goverment is sensitie about it being seen.
  
  - Only used for protestors and journalists

- Flooding
  
  - Drow up critical thoughts in a see of pro gov message using internet trolls and a load of opposing articles
