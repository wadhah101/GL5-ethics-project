## Presentation

Hello. Artificial intelligence in china is used to monitor people and they are really good at detecting your face and the goverment is evil.

Thank you for attention. presentation is over

## Introduction

Before diving into the rise of artificial intelligence in china we need to explore the exisiting policies and political climate in china but even before that I like to mention a novel called 1984 and leave you to draw the parallels 

## Nineteen Eighty-Four

**Big brother is watching background**

[The Dystopian World of 1984 Explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQxOKXEff4I)

Nineteen Eighty-Four is a famous novel written by X. It revolves around a world living a dystopian future where utalitirism rained, indivudualism is dead,reality and history are just a matter of opinion.

Constant surveillance of everey citizen is the norm

control of information to such extent that fact are not reality and reality can be changed on the whim of big brother and "the party"

The party have a monopoly on facts and political discourbe ( debates )

society is divided into 3 

- Inner party 2%

- outer party 13% ( bureaucrats )

- the proles, easy to manipulate : creating a fake crisis, nationalistic pandering, common enemy

what this has to do with china ? everything 

## Internet control and the great firewall: controlling the truth

**tankman background**

What happened in june 1989 at Tiananmen Square ?

**Absolutely nothing**

As we all know China blocks facebook, twitter, google, wikipedia ... but that can be easily evaded by paying few dollars a month for a VPN. so does china really control the internet ?

How can it control the internet without giving the impression to the average citizen you are doing so ?

The golden shield project or what's know today as the great firewall

- site blocking 

- topic filtering

- search result rearrangement

- mass surveillance

Each company in china is required to hire "content moderators" or whats better known as "sensors". The official number of those workers are **2 million**

Here's the thing, complaning about the goverment is allowed and mostly a blind eye is turned on it but **mobilising people through a rally** is **strictly** censored 

China is about finding a middle ground to maintain control to voice opinions but not let them act based on them.

by law the browsing activity of eveyone is collected by internet provider and passed to the goverment. With the rising of big data and data analysis we can all see what's wrong and the goverment actually uses this data to make political decisions.

In the book "censored distraction and diversion inside china's great firewall" 3 methods are described on how the goverment controls the internet : 

- Fear & threats
  
  - Effective immediatly but there's a reaction of people  trying to seek out infromation if they feel the goverment is sensitie about it being seen.
  
  - Only used for protestors and journalists

- Flooding
  
  - Drow up critical thoughts in a see of pro gov message using internet trolls and a load of opposing article

- Friction
  
  - Increase the cost of finding information
  
  - Make parts of applications slower
  
  - Ban website with the knowledge of  exisiting vpns
  
  - This strategy the most popular and relies on our lack of patience 
  
  - The average citizen will just use the service that "just works" and mostly it is goverment controlled platform



So do you think that's dystopian enought ? we just started.

## The social credit system: Big data meets Big brother

https://nebula.tv/videos/real-life-lore-yt-what-life-under-china-s-social-credit-system-could-be-like

What if every action you took in your life was recorded in a score like a videogame ?

- Good actions raise your score

- Bad actions lower your score

- Your scope can be looked up online

**You score is used to judge you**

A new episode of black mirror ? Certainly not for 17% of the human population

Introduing the social credit system

Big brother is giving you a score through a load of personal data: 

- Financial and crinimal records

- online search history

- social media posts

The goverment will score based on what it deems **better social behavior** and a bad score will make your life **HARDER**

- Ban on using public transport

- Ban on flight and exit visa

- losing access and children access for university

- Ban on dating apps

Some of this activites are but not limited to:

- Donating blood

- Volunteer work

- Paying bills in time

- Being a model employee

Looking good  isn't it ? There's some other activities that can help too:

- Praising the goverment online

- Praising the crackdown on polictal and religious "extremes"

But some of bad activites consist of:

- cheating at video game

- Playing an excessive amount of video games

- Participating in a "cult"

- missing on appointments

- Spreading "fake news"

- not visiting your parents

- participating in protests against the chinese authority

How is being powered ? 

**620 million cctv camera nationwide** That's a camera for every two persons in china all capable of real time facial recognition

The results ?

28 million banned sale of airplane tickets    

Things are getting closer and closer to 1984. Let's now explore The age of artificial intelligence

## The age of artificial intelligence:  1984 is 2022

In the previous years the chinese goverment have collected a tremendious amount of  data alongside personal identifying information for every citizen as every person is required to have a state issued ID card which enables mass surveillance in real time.

Let's exlore some real world applictions

- jay walking

### Jaw walking

crossing the street illegally in china ( in a red light ) will result in a camera taking a photo of you, identifying you instantially and issueing a fine alongside public display of your face in the screen of crosswalk 

### Pay with your face

Payment technologies using facial recognition are slowly becoming the norm in china

### Toilet paper waste control

In a lot of public places you can not get toilet paper without identifying with your face

### Office monitoring

Camera enable employer to check employee ,entry and leave time, their mood and their productivity

### Searching

600 million CCTV country wide enable the goverment to easily find any target ( a person, a car) and monitor their movement in nearly real time

### Crowd control

AI can monitor crowds for their size and the period each person have stayed in the same zone detecting unsual activities (protests) in real time allowing action to be taken immediatly with minimal damage

### Goverment housing (Dorms)

Cameras monitor the residental complexes and control access to house. It keeps track of number of visitors and unsual activties of residents

### Negvi & skynet

Half a milion dollars  investment from the chinese goverment

A rising tech company specialized in video stream processing and cross checking facial data against enourmous goverment databases being mainly oriented  at crinimal databases.

3000 cases have been caught in 2021 using this system ironically called Skynet

### Education

**Certain** private expirmental schools are using headbands and cameras to monitor student during the class.

Certain devices are able to check brain activity throught its electric signals and the data is sent to the teacher computer in realtime making him able to distinguish who's paying attention and who is not.
