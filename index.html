				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Before we dive into the rise of artificial intelligence in China, we
					need to explore existing government policies and the political
					climate there.
				</p>
				<p>
					But even before that I'd like to refer to a novel called 1984 and
					have you draw the parallels.

				<h2>Nineteen Eighty-Four</h2>
				<p>
					Nineteen Eighty-Four is a famous novel written by George Orwell. It
					revolves around a world living in a dystopian future where
					utilitarianism rains, individualism is dead, and reality alongside
					history are just a matter of opinion.
